# scoby-nb
Example notebooks for the [scoby](https://github.com/ramseykarim/scoby) software for creating synthetic spectra and related products from real stellar catalogs.

To use these notebooks, you'll need to clone the scoby repository (link above). Further instructions are in the notebook!

I separated the notebooks out from the core code so you don't have to download a bunch of notebooks if you don't want to; you could even just read these notebooks on GitHub without even downloading or running them!
